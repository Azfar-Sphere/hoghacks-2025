Team Name: UALR ACM
Project Name: KidKash
Description: 

Want to buy groceries? Better get approval first!
KidKash flips family finances on its head by combining a digital storefront with real-time kid approval. Parents browse and add items to their cart, but before they can check out, they must receive a head nod from their kids — powered by computer vision.

"Can I buy milk?"
"Nope, only chocolate milk passes the vibe check!"

With KidKash, parents handle the shopping, but kids hold the power. This playful app transforms family spending into a collaborative game of trust, negotiation, and tiny tyrant vetoes. It’s Yin and Yang, allowance-style.
